Optimizing small storage spaces: modular plywood shelving units with authenticated version-controlled inventory tracking (working copy)

## System requirements
- This modular physical inventory system is designed to accomodate the majority of plastic storage containers (i.e. tuppawear) by storing them on deep plywood shelves that accomodate the long side of the container lengths. In other words, store tuppwear containers on shelving so that the short side of the container is facing you. For small spaces, it is likely that doing so will maximize cubic feet of storage space available in the room, because in smaller rooms, the storage space is almost always a function of the perimeter. You don't have a warehouse with isles; you have a small storage area (such as an unfinished basement) with a wall perimeter that can be utilized for storage. As such, the shelving depth is fixed at 32 inches.
- The physical inventory system must have a searchable inventory of physical objects with a map to their location. The physical inventory tracking must be capable of multi-user version control with identity authentication.
- The shelving system must be modular; that is, every feature of the shelving must be transportable and reconfigurable.
- Must utilize a functional system design (i.e. functional programming) with minimal user input: with the proposed configuration, so long as your targetted room perimeter can accomodate shelving with a depth of 32 inches, the entire system design has only two functional inputs: length of available room perimeter (available horizontal clearance) and number of shelves (vertical clearance).

## Shelve clearance requirements
- A 21-in vertical clearance can accomodate most plastic containers.
- Shelves with a depth of 32 inches are optimal for the following reasons:
  - We want to constuct deep shelves that accomodate the long side of most containers. A depth of 32 inches can accomodate the long side of most tuppawear containers. For small spaces, it is likely that deeper, 32 inch shelves will maximize cubic feet of storage space available in the room, because in smaller rooms, the storage space is almost always a function of the perimeter. You don't have a warehouse with isles; you have a small storage area (such as an unfinished basement) with a wall perimeter that can be utilized for storage. As such, the shelving depth is fixed at 32 inches.
  -  An 8-ft-by-4-ft sheet of plywood can be cut into three 32 inch x 48 inch rectangles. By keeping the 32 inch shelf depth constant, the smaller 32-in x 48-in rectangles can be cut and combined to accomodate any shelf width. It also simplifies quantity calculations for lumber and cubic feet of functional storage.

### Modular requirements
- Assembled with two-by-four dimensional lumber, plywood sheets, and undamaged screws and without wood glue (can be rapidly deconstructed and reconfigured with minimal tooling)
- The legs of each modular shelving unit raise the first box off the floor by 4". Shelving that is not easily transportable is not modular. The 4 inch ground clearance provides an off-the-ground location (i.e. handles) to lift from below.
- Modular shelves can be reconfigured, re-used, and recycled as conditions change.
